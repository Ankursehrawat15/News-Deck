## Project Overview


The goal is to create a News Feed app that gives a user regularly updated news from the internet 
related to a particular topic, person, or location. You can search for the news directly as well.


## API Key Note

You need to insert your API key.
Go to the package named `Fragments` and insert the your Api key from 'News.Api'.
This needs to be done in all the fragments java files.

```
  private static final String API_KEY = "Your Api Key Here";
```

Go to the file named `ApiClient.java` and insert the your baseUrl from 'News.Api'
```
  private static final String BASE_URL = "Your Base Url Here";
```
